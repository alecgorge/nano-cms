NEW REQUIREMENTS
-----------------
PHP 5.2 or better
Apache (v2 or better perfered, but v1 will work. [others will work if you can convert .htaccess file properly])

FIXES
-----------------
fixed bug where htaccess file was deleted. Now it just prepends the mod_rewrite stuff when enabling clean urls and does nothing when they are disabled.
fixed problems with UTF-8 support. Slugifying for Cyrillic, English-like (English, Spanish etc) and Greek all works.
fixed bug where when page1 and page2 exist and page1 is renamed to page2, page2's content is replaced without warning.
made it so when clean urls are enabled, normal get varibles are still passed (for example on example.com/nanocms/how-to-install?gallery=10 $_GET['gallery'] will equal 10 not nothing)
define NANO_SEFURL before tweaks are loaded so that they can access them
better mod_rewrite detection, and more graceful fallback
upgraded jQuery to 1.3.2 from 1.2.6
renamed pagedata.txt to pagedata.inc
created a default .htaccess file which blocks directory listings, removes magic_quotes_gpc, register globals and hides .inc files from the browser. This means tweaks and NanoCMS core can use .inc files for data storage that will be block from the browser
changed password hash from MD5 (128-bit) to Whirlpool (512-Bit). The hash of "demo" doesn't show up in Google and it has no known vulerabilities. This is the hash of "demo" (no quotes): c53323891c805766b5465dfb1f511a8fb216d30ad0e3fb690aab6e75ee3819706f92f1f8cca58245ca5672213a42f38a8f8f60c302021ce5497b3087e6b049fe
changed error reporting to E_ALL  & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED
replaced all the single byte functions with the multibyte functions as mentioned here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.overload.php
