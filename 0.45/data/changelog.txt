FIXES
-----------------
fixed bug where htaccess file was deleted. Now it just prepends the mod_rewrite stuff when enabling clean urls and does nothing when they are disabled.
fixed problems with UTF-8 support. Slugifying for Cyrillic, English-like (English, Spanish etc) and Greek all works.
fixed bug where when page1 and page2 exist and page1 is renamed to page2, page2's content is replaced without warning.
made it so when clean urls are enabled, normal get varibles are still passed (for example on example.com/nanocms/how-to-install?gallery=10 $_GET['gallery'] will equal 10 not nothing)
define NANO_SEFURL before tweaks are loaded so that they can access them
