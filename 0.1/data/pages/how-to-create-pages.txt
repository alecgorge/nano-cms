<h2>What are sidebar pages?</h2>
<p>
 Sidebar pages are those pages which are linked through the left sidebar.<br>
 Once the page is created...the link for that page is automatically inserted into the sidebar links.<br>
 You can select the order in which they should appear in the admin panel<br>
</p>

<h2>What are Other pages?</h2>
<p>
 As we know all pages cannot be listed in the sidebar alone.<br>
 Other pages are those pages which are to solve the above problem. <br>
 You can use this feature to add more pages to which you can link manually<br>
 You will have to link these pages manually and their respective url's are shown in the admin panel in the <b>Show Pages and Options</b> section :)
