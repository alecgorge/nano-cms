Nano CMS is the tiniest CMS you can find around. The user interface and the functionality are very very simple and extremely easy to use.
The core feature of NanoCMS is that it is filebased and does not use any database at all, which makes it super easy to install - just extract and that's it.

Pages can be created through this CMS in a breeze without touching any code, and added to that links to those pages are generated automatically too.
Customizing the design/look and feel is very simple too, it just takes 5 minutes even for newbies.
